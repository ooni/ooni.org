# OONI Code of Conduct


Statement of Intent:

**The Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) is committed to providing
a safe and inclusive environment for its global community.** 

This Code of Conduct applies to OONI as a whole, including all (online and offline) OONI community spaces, such as the [OONI Slack channel](https://slack.ooni.org/) and OONI mailing lists. It is intended to
provide guidelines for community members. Employees and contractors of OONI
are also subject to organizational policies and procedures. 

This Code of Conduct is not exhaustive or complete. It is an ongoing effort to
summarize our shared understanding. We want to provide a welcoming, safe
environment, so we can work together to pursue powerful solutions. We reserve
the right to deviate from strictly enforcing this code. Any deviations must
produce an outcome which is fairer, and aligned with our values. We understand
that keeping a living document relevant and “patched” involves sustained
effort.

0. Summary

  DO: Be kind, thoughtful, and considerate.

  DO: Make OONI a place where people are happy and comfortable.

  DO: Remember: We are all contributing; we are all learning. Nobody was born
    an expert.

  DO: Yield the floor. Listen. Make sure everyone gets heard.

  DON'T: Insult, harass, intimidate, or discriminate.

  DON'T: Treat honest mistakes as an excuse to hassle people. Mistakes are for
    learning.

  DON'T: Hunt for ways to uphold the letter of this code while violating its
    spirit.

  AND DO: Eagerly email: team@openobservatory.org with
    questions or concerns.

1. Purpose

A primary goal of the OONI community is to be inclusive of many different
contributors. We want to include contributors from the most varied and diverse
backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe
and welcoming environment for all, regardless of their experience, gender
identity or expression, sexual orientation, family, relationships, ability
(whether bodily or mental), personal appearance, socioeconomic status, body
size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or membership in a
disadvantaged and/or underrepresented group.

A safe environment means one free from abuse, whether isolated or systemic. We
explicitly acknowledge that tolerating abuse is a security problem. Allowing
abusers and malicious people to disrupt our community puts our software,
developers, and users at risk.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in
our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in OONI to help us create safe
and positive experiences for everyone.

2. Be your best self

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

  * Participate in an honest and active way. In doing so, you contribute to
    the health and longevity of this community.

  * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.

  * Attempt collaboration and dialogue before engaging in conflict.

  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

  * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert
    community leaders if you notice:

    - a dangerous situation

    - someone in distress

    - violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem minor

  * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the
    public. Please be respectful to everyone using these locations.

  * Respect the privacy of your fellow community members.

3. Unacceptable behaviors

The following behaviors are **unacceptable** within our community:

  * Violence, sexual assault, threats of violence, or violent language
    directed against another person, especially violence against a person or
    group based on a protected characteristic. (Display of weapons may
    constitute intimidation or a threat of violence.)

  * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise
    discriminatory jokes and language.

  * Bullying. 

  * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent
    material. 

  * Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying
    information ("doxing") without their consent.

    information. You should have someone's consent before recording these
    things, and before posting them publicly.

4. Unacceptable behavior has consequences

We will not tolerate unacceptable behavior from any community member. We will
not make exceptions for sponsors and those with decision-making authority.
People in formal or informal leadership roles must model the highest standards
of behavior.

Anyone asked by another community member to stop unacceptable behavior is
expected to comply immediately. Please don't step in on someone else's behalf
without their consent.

5. Where to go for help

The OONI team can assist with intra-community conflict resolution. You can contact
the whole OONI team:

  - if you have questions or concerns about the Code of Conduct, or

  - if you feel that you have witnessed a Code of Conduct violation

However, if you feel that there is a conflict of interest with any team
member, you may contact members individually. See: https://ooni.org/about/#team.

6. What to do if you witness unacceptable behavior

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
concerns, please notify the OONI team as soon as possible. You can
contact the OONI team in person, or at
team@openobservatory.org. Current team members are listed
on the [about page](https://ooni.org/about/#team). The OONI team's incident response will vary on a
case-by-case basis. We will make every effort to respond to the
incident immediately. We will prioritize the safety of the person who
has been harmed, or is at risk of harm. Person(s) who have been harmed or are
at risk of harm can withdraw the incident report at any time. We will never do
anything without the consent of the person who has been harmed or is at risk of
harm, except in situations where there is a threat of imminent danger or harm
to anyone.

7. What the person reporting a violation can expect

The OONI team prioritizes the safety and well-being of any person who
feels that they have been harmed or may be in danger of being harmed. Anyone
reporting an issue to the OONI team can expect that their report will
be taken seriously. Initial reports can be taken in written or verbal form.
The next steps in an incident response will vary on a case-by-case basis.

8. How the OONI team responds to incidents

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the OONI team
may take any action they deem appropriate, including but not limited to a
warning, informal mediation, temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the
community. 

9. Scope of this document

This code of conduct covers all community participants:

  - paid and unpaid contributors

  - sponsors

  - other guests

when interacting:

  - in all online and in-person community venues

  - in one-on-one communications that relate to community work

This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable
behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior
has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community
members. As members of the OONI community, we support and follow this Code while
we are working on OONI, and take care not to undermine it in the rest of our
time.
