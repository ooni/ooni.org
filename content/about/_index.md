Founded in 2012, the **Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)** is a non-profit free software project that aims to empower decentralized efforts in documenting internet censorship around the world.

To this end, we work on:

- **Free software for measuring internet censorship.** Through our [OONI Probe app](https://ooni.org/install/), you can [measure](https://ooni.org/nettest/) the blocking of websites, instant messaging apps, and circumvention tools, and you can measure network performance. We aim to empower the public to independently detect information controls on the internet.
- **Real-time analysis and open publication of censorship measurements from around the world.** As soon as you run OONI Probe, your test results are automatically published as open data in real-time. [OONI Explorer](https://explorer.ooni.org/) and the [OONI API](https://api.ooni.io/) enable the public to track censorship events around the world in real-time based on openly available measurement data that can potentially serve as evidence.
- **Research reports documenting censorship events around the world.** In collaboration with our [partners](https://ooni.org/partners), we publish [research reports](https://ooni.org/reports/) documenting cases of internet censorship around the world. These reports share relevant OONI measurements and aim to enable human rights defenders, journalists, activists, and lawyers to use these censorship findings as part of their work.

Thanks to our global community, [more than a billion network measurements](https://explorer.ooni.org/) have been published from more than 200 countries, shedding light on cases of internet censorship worldwide.

Join our community by [running OONI Probe](https://ooni.org/install/) to contribute measurements! But please read our **[Data Policy](/about/data-policy)** and **[documentation about potential risks](/about/risks/)** first.

## Mission

Our mission is to ensure a free and open internet by increasing transparency of internet censorship around the world.

We believe that everyone should have equal and open access to information. We aim to help create and defend an internet where human rights -- particularly freedom of expression and access to information -- are promoted and protected around the world.

We know that we canâ€™t do this alone. This is why we have built a decentralized internet censorship observatory, powered by human rights defenders worldwide.

We create [free and open source network measurement tools](https://ooni.org/install/) that anyone can use to measure internet censorship.

We [openly publish measurements](https://ooni.org/data/) to provide a public archive on network interference and to increase transparency of internet censorship around the world.

All of our methodologies, tools, and measurements are entirely open, transparent, and peer-reviewed.

By increasing transparency of internet censorship, we aim to support public debate on information controls and promote social justice on the internet.
