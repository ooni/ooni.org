    title: When governments censor websites and block messaging apps like Telegram, here's where to turn for proof
    text: All of the data collected by OONI's measurement software — called probes — is stored in a publicly accessible database, where anyone can go to understand what's being blocked, filtered, or throttled in a particular country, and how. That data can be used to track the evolution of information controls over time or link censorship with political events like elections and protests.

    title: 'Search result not found: China bans Wikipedia in all languages'
    text: The community-edited online encyclopedia was barred in April, according to a new report from the censorship research group, the Open Observatory of Network Interference. This means Beijing’s ban of the Chinese-language edition has been extended to swallow Wikipedia’s entire platform.

    text: 'The report published Tuesday by the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) organization shows how extensive the measures are. “The scale of internet censorship in Myanmar has become quite unprecedented,” it said.
    In addition to the military’s blocking of social media, Wikipedia and 174 news sites, the NGO also found the targeted blocking of websites that offer ways to circumvent internet blockades.'
