This test measures the reachability of the [Tor network](https://www.torproject.org/) (which is designed for online anonymity
and censorship circumvention).

The Vanilla Tor test attempts to start a connection to the Tor network. If the
test successfully bootstraps a connection within a predefined amount of seconds (300 by default),
then Tor is considered to be reachable from the vantage point of the user. But if the test
does *not* manage to establish a connection, then the Tor network is likely blocked within the
tested network.
