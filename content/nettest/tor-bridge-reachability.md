This test examines whether **[Tor bridges](https://bridges.torproject.org/)**
work in tested networks.

[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) is free and open source software which
enables online anonymity and censorship circumvention. It was designed to bounce
communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers around
the world, thus hiding users' IP address and circumventing online tracking and
censorship. However, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in various countries
around the world are often ordered by their governments to block users' access
to Tor. As a result, Tor bridges were developed to enable users to connect to
the Tor network in countries where such access is blocked.

This test runs Tor with a list of bridges and if it's able to connect to them
successfully, we consider that Tor bridges are not blocked in the tested
network. If the test, however, is unable to bootstrap a connection, then the Tor
bridges are either offline or blocked.
