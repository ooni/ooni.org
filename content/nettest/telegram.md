This test is designed to examine the reachability of Telegram's app and web
version within a tested network.

More specifically, this test attempts to perform an HTTP POST request, and
establish a TCP connection to Telegram’s access points (DCs), as well as an
HTTPS GET request to Telegram's web version (`web.telegram.org`) over the
vantage point of the user. The test is triggered as blocking when connections
to *all* access points defined in the [test](
https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/blob/112452a3c6c76843e21ac347f449068840df78f9/internal/experiment/telegram/telegram.go#L89-L97)
fail.

Based on this methodology Telegram’s *app* is likely blocked if any of the
following apply:

* TCP connections to all the tested Telegram access points fail

* HTTP POST requests to Telegram's access points do *not* send back a
response to OONI's servers.

Telegram's *web version* is likely blocked if the following applies:

* HTTPS GET request to `web.telegram.org` do *not* send back a consistent
response to OONI's servers.
