Today we are thrilled to publish an interview with Siti Nurliza: a talented data analyst and technologist with [Sinar Project](https://sinarproject.org/), one of our most dedicated and long-term [partners](https://ooni.org/partners/sinar-project/) who have led OONI censorship measurement efforts in Southeast Asia for more
than 6 years!

[Sinar Project](https://sinarproject.org/) is a civic tech initiative using open technology, open data and policy analysis to systematically make important information public and more accessible to
the Malaysian people. Over the years, we [collaborated](https://ooni.org/partners/sinar-project) with Sinar Project on measuring and reporting on internet censorship in
[Malaysia](https://ooni.org/post/malaysia-report/), [Indonesia](https://ooni.org/post/indonesia-internet-censorship/),
[Thailand](https://ooni.torproject.org/post/thailand-internet-censorship/), and [Myanmar](https://ooni.org/post/myanmar-report/)
through the use of OONI tools and data.

Now that Sinar Project has Siti -- *a talented data analyst with extensive expertise with OONI data* -- they independently lead censorship measurement and reporting efforts in Southeast Asia in
collaboration with their regional [partners](https://imap.sinarproject.org/partners).

Notably, they established the [**Internet Monitoring Action Project (iMAP)**](https://imap.sinarproject.org/) project to
monitor and report on internet censorship (through the use of [OONI tools](https://ooni.org/install/) and [data](https://ooni.org/data/)) in **10 countries**: Cambodia, Hong Kong (China), India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar,
Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Vietnam.

As part of her work on the [iMAP project](https://imap.sinarproject.org/), Siti does incredible work supporting communities in Southeast Asia to use OONI
tools, she analyzes OONI measurements collected from the region to identify censorship events, and she provides OONI data analysis support
for regional advocacy efforts.

Based on Siti's OONI data analysis, the [iMAP project](https://imap.sinarproject.org/) publishes annual
"State of Internet Censorship" reports which cover the state of internet censorship all over the region:

* **iMAP State of Internet Censorship Reports 2022**: [https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2022](https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2022)
* **iMAP State of Internet Censorship Reports 2023**: [https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2023](https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2023)

Learn more about the **iMAP 2023 Internet Censorship Reports** by watching their **[online launch event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkFQxzvJrMs)**. 

We'll be publishing more interviews with community members over the next
months. [Subscribe to our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQhDgj9wBf4_w5bWFvLlq-w?sub_confirmation=1)
