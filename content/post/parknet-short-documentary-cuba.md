Last year we had the opportunity to travel to Cuba to explore its internet
landscape. We spent most of our time hopping from one public WiFi hotspot to
another, measuring networks in Havana, Santa Clara, and Santiago de Cuba. You
might remember that we published a [research report](https://ooni.org/post/cuba-internet-censorship-2017/) on our findings.

Today we publish a **short documentary (“ParkNet”)** on our study of internet
censorship in Cuba.

“ParkNet” is a term that we coined to refer to parks that serve as public WiFi
hotspots in Cuba. You can also access the internet from many other public
spaces, but we found parks to be particularly interesting due to the sort of
collective experience that they offer when "visiting” the internet.

The aim of this documentary is to share some of our keys findings and to provide
a feel of Cuba’s unique internet landscape. We also wanted to experiment with
the idea of presenting censorship findings with video.

Our [OONI YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQhDgj9wBf4_w5bWFvLlq-w) will feature new and exciting content over the next months. [Subscribe to receive updates](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQhDgj9wBf4_w5bWFvLlq-w?sub_confirmation=1)!
