# OONI training course

By taking the **[OONI training course](https://advocacyassembly.org/en/courses/63/#/chapter/1/lesson/1)
(“Measuring Internet Censorship with OONI tools”)** on Advocacy
Assembly, you will learn how to investigate internet censorship through
the use of [OONI tools](https://ooni.org/install/) and
[data](https://ooni.org/data/).

## Why take the course?

Almost every country in the world experiences some form of internet
censorship. What differs from country to country is *which* websites and
apps are blocked, and the *impact* of their block.

During elections and protests around the world, governments frequently
instruct the [blocking of major social media platforms](https://ooni.org/reports/) (such as WhatsApp and Facebook).
In many countries, governments also instruct the blocking of independent
news media, minority group websites, and a number of other online
platforms.

By taking this course, you will learn how to measure internet censorship
and help keep those in power to account.

## Who is the course for?

The OONI training course was designed for human rights defenders,
activists, journalists, and researchers interested in investigating and
responding to internet censorship around the world.

But anyone interested in learning how to measure internet censorship is
encouraged to take the course! It’s beginner level, and no technical
knowledge is required.

We especially hope that this course will be useful to our
[partners](https://ooni.org/partners) and that it will help support
OONI community engagement efforts around the world.

## What does the course entail?

To make things fun, the course includes a mix of **videos, screencasts,
slides, quizzes and hands-on exercises**. It also includes case studies
