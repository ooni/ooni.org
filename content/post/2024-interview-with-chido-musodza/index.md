Today we are excited to publish an interview with **Chido Musodza**, Program Associate, Community Engagement at [Localization Lab](https://www.localizationlab.org/). Chido is passionate about supporting minority language communities through the localization of open-source technology. Localization, on the one hand, makes tech products more inclusive and on the other hand, empowers the development of minority languages and their presence in digital space. 

Watch Chido’s interview to learn more about the need for localization and community engagement!
