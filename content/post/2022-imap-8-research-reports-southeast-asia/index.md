On 21st December 2022, our long-term partner, [Sinar Project](https://ooni.org/partners/sinar-project/), published **[8 new research reports](https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2022)** on
internet censorship in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong (China) in collaboration with their
[Internet Monitoring and Action Project (iMAP)](https://imap.sinarproject.org/) partners. We are particularly
excited about these reports as they make use of [OONI data](https://ooni.org/data)!

[Internet Monitoring Action Project (iMAP)](https://imap.sinarproject.org/about) aims to establish regional
and in-country networks that monitor network interference and
restrictions to the freedom of expression online in 8 countries:
Myanmar, Cambodia, Hong Kong (China), Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines,
Thailand, and Vietnam.

[Sinar Project](https://sinarproject.org/) leads these efforts in
collaboration with national digital rights
[partners](https://imap.sinarproject.org/partners) in these countries.
As part of the iMAP project, they updated the [Citizen Lab test lists](https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists) to
ensure that relevant websites are tested for censorship in Southeast
Asia, and they analyzed [OONI data](https://ooni.org/data) to
investigate internet censorship in the region. The analysis period
included measurements collected between 1st January 2022 to 30th June
2022.

As a result of this work, they published [iMAP State of Internet Censorship research reports](https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2022) for:

* [Cambodia](https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2022/imap-state-of-internet-censorship-country-report-2022-cambodia/2022-cambodia.pdf)

* [Hong Kong](https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2022/imap-state-of-internet-censorship-country-report-2022-hong-kong/2022-hong-kong) (China)

* [Indonesia](https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2022/the-state-of-internet-censorship-in-indonesia-2022/2022-indonesia)

* [Malaysia](https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2022/imap-state-of-internet-censorship-country-report-2022-malaysia/2022-malaysia.pdf)

* [Vietnam](https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2022/imap-state-of-internet-censorship-country-report-2022-vietnam/2022-vietnam)

Our iMAP partners also published a full **[research report that incorporates all the 8 reports mentioned above](https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2022/imap-state-of-censorship-report-2022-full-report/2022-full-report)**. Moreover, they published an **[Interactive Dashboard](https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2022/interactive-dashboard)**
with the key findings from all countries.

Congratulations to iMAP partners for this excellent work, and for documenting internet censorship in the region!
