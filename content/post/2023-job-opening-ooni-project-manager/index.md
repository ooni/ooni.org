# About 

## OONI

The [Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)](https://ooni.org/) is a free software project --
born out of the [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/)
in 2012 -- that aims to empower decentralized efforts in increasing
transparency of internet censorship around the world.

We build free software ([OONI Probe](https://ooni.org/install/)) that enables anyone to
independently detect internet censorship on their network. To increase
transparency of internet censorship, we publish censorship measurements
as [open data](https://ooni.org/data/) in near real-time.
This data supports [research](https://ooni.org/reports/)
and [advocacy efforts](https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/) investigating
and fighting internet censorship worldwide.

More information about OONI is available in our [Mission Statement](https://ooni.org/about/) and
[FAQ](https://ooni.org/support/faq).

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

We have a [global and diverse community](https://ooni.org/partners) and we strive to hire
people who can best serve our community.

Our [Code of Conduct](https://ooni.org/get-involved/code-of-conduct/)
describes how we aim to provide a safe, welcoming, and inclusive
environment for our team and community.

We value and encourage diversity and consider applicants for all
positions without regard to national origin, gender, gender
identity and expression, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical
characteristics, disability, religion, and age.

We encourage people subject to systemic bias to apply, including people
of color, indigenous people, LGBTQIA+ people, women, and any other
person who is part of a group that is underrepresented in tech.
