Last month the [OONI](https://ooni.torproject.org/) team joined the internet
freedom community at the following events:

* [Vietnam Cyber Dialogue (VCD)](https://internetfreedomfestival.org/vietnam-cyber-dialogue/)

* [Internet Freedom Festival (IFF)](https://internetfreedomfestival.org/)

* [Iran Cyber Dialogue (ICD)](https://www.accessnow.org/iran-cyber-dialogue-rightscon-brussels-2017-timely-impactful/)

* [RightsCon 2017](https://www.rightscon.org/)

These events provided us with the opportunity to engage with community members,
create new friendships, learn about new projects, and to share skills and
knowledge. We also had the opportunity to facilitate sessions that allowed us to
collect feedback for the improvement of our
[software](https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe) and research
methodologies.

Below we list the sessions that we (co-) facilitated as part of these events.
