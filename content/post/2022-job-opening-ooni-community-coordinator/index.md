The application deadline is **Sunday, 12th June 2022**.

# Job description

By joining our team, you will support our

rights defenders to measure and fight internet censorship. Our community
is at the heart of our work, and you will play an important role in
helping to ensure that our tools meet the needs of our community.

In this position, you will:

* Collaborate on strengthening and building new partnerships with
digital rights organizations.

* Support our [global network of partners](https://ooni.org/partners) and broader community (e.g.
explaining how to use [OONI tools](https://ooni.org/install/)
and [data](https://ooni.org/data/), answering [OONI-related questions](https://ooni.org/support/faq/)).

* Coordinate localization efforts (i.e.
[translation](https://www.transifex.com/otf/ooniprobe/) of OONI
tools and documentation).

* Collaborate on maintenance and improvement of OONI documentation.

* Collaborate on creating resources in support of community engagement
activities (such as screencasts and other educational materials).

* Coordinate with our partners on updating the [test lists](https://ooni.org/get-involved/contribute-test-lists) (i.e.
lists of websites tested for censorship).

* Facilitate (online and/or in-person) OONI workshops (to engage
communities worldwide with OONI tools).

* Document community needs and feedback for the improvement of OONI
tools.

* Collaborate on organizing OONI community meetings and events.

* Support OONI outreach efforts (such as communications on our
[Slack](https://slack.ooni.org/) channel, mailing lists, and
social media channels).

This is a **full-time 12-month contract position**, starting ASAP. The
contract may be extended depending on the contractor’s performance and
the availability of funds. The yearly contractor fee will range between
**40,000-50,000 EUR** depending on the contractor’s relevant experience

**This is a fully remote position.** Even before the COVID-19 pandemic,
the OONI team always worked remotely online. We communicate and
coordinate through [OONI Slack channels](https://slack.ooni.org/), we
have video/voice meetings regularly, and we track our work on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ooni).

Our [team members](https://ooni.org/about/#team) are currently based
in Europe, Africa, and North America, but we encourage applications from
anywhere in the world.

* General understanding of internet censorship and digital rights
issues.

# About

## OONI

Born in 2012 (out of the [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/)),
the [Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)](https://ooni.org/)
is a non-profit, free software project that aims to empower
decentralized efforts in increasing transparency of internet censorship
around the world.

We build free software ([OONI Probe](https://ooni.org/install/)) that
enables anyone to independently detect internet censorship on their
network. With more than 100k installs, OONI Probe is run by users in
[more than 160 countries](https://explorer.ooni.org/) every month. To
increase transparency of internet censorship, we publish censorship
measurements as [open data](https://ooni.org/data/) in near real-time.
This data supports [research](https://ooni.org/reports/) and [advocacy efforts](https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/) investigating and fighting
internet censorship worldwide.

OONI is currently fiscally sponsored by the [Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights](https://www.hermescenter.org/).
More information about OONI is available in our [Mission Statement](https://ooni.org/about/) and
[FAQ](https://ooni.org/support/faq).

## OONI community

At heart, OONI has always been a community-driven project, powered by
the internet freedom fighters worldwide who run [OONI Probe](https://ooni.org/install/) and contribute measurements. The OONI
community is global and diverse, consisting of researchers, human rights
defenders, journalists, and technologists around the world.

Since 2016, we have established [partnerships with 41 digital rights organizations](https://ooni.org/partners), many of which include
non-profit organizations in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South
America. The aim of the [OONI Partnership Program](https://ooni.org/get-involved/partnership-program/) is to
collaborate on the study of internet censorship and to support
vulnerable populations by increasing transparency of information
controls. Since 2016, OONI has been an active member of Access Now’s
[#KeepItOn campaign](https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/) (an
international coalition of human rights organizations fighting internet
shutdowns) supporting advocacy efforts with censorship measurement data.

we strive to hire people who can best serve our community.

Our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ooni/ooni.org/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
