Earlier this year, we had the opportunity to host the **OONI Partner Gathering 2024**: a two-day event in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where we brought our [partners](https://ooni.org/partners) from Asia and the Middle East together to exchange skills and knowledge on internet censorship research. Our goal was to strengthen global and regional collaborations on censorship measurement research and advocacy. We previously published a [report](https://ooni.org/post/2024-ooni-partner-gathering-report/) which shares details about the event and its outcomes.

Today, we are excited to share a **new animation** about the [OONI Partner Gathering 2024](https://ooni.org/post/2024-ooni-partner-gathering-report/). This animation provides a glimpse into the event, highlighting the importance of community participation in censorship measurement research. Watch the animation below!
