On 22st October 2024, our long-term partner, [Sinar Project](https://ooni.org/partners/sinar-project/), published **[9 new research reports](https://imap.sinarproject.org/reports/2024)** on
internet censorship in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong (China) in collaboration with their
[Internet Monitoring and Action Project (iMAP)](https://imap.sinarproject.org/) partners. These reports are based on [OONI data](https://ooni.org/data) collected between July 2023 to June 2024 from 9 countries: Cambodia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. 

[Internet Monitoring Action Project (iMAP)](https://imap.sinarproject.org/about) aims to establish regional
and in-country networks that monitor network interference and
restrictions to the freedom of expression online in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong (China) in
collaboration with national digital rights
[partners](https://imap.sinarproject.org/partners) in these countries.
