## About OONI

The[ Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)](https://ooni.org/) is a
free software project – born out of the[ Tor
Project](https://www.torproject.org/) in 2012 – that aims to empower
decentralized efforts in increasing transparency of internet censorship around
the world.

We build free software ([OONI Probe](https://ooni.org/install/)) that enables
anyone to independently detect internet censorship on their network. To
increase transparency of internet censorship, we publish censorship
measurements as[ open data](https://ooni.org/data/) in near real-time. This
data supports[ research](https://ooni.org/reports/) and[ advocacy
efforts](https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/) investigating and fighting
internet censorship worldwide.

Statement](https://ooni.org/about/#mission) and [FAQ](https://ooni.org/support/faq).
