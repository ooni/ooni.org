## About 


### OONI

anyone to independently detect internet censorship on their network. To
increase transparency of internet censorship, we publish censorship
measurements as[ open data](https://ooni.org/data/) in near real-time. This
data supports[ research](https://ooni.org/reports/) and[ advocacy
efforts](https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/) investigating and fighting
internet censorship worldwide.

More information about OONI is available in our[ Mission
Statement](https://ooni.org/about/) and[ FAQ](https://ooni.org/support/faq).
