Are you a mobile developer interested in defending human rights on the
internet? We have a job opening for you!

The [OONI](https://ooni.org/) team (a non-profit fighting internet
censorship, originally born out of the [Tor
Project](https://www.torproject.org/)) is looking for a dedicated
**mobile developer** to work on [OONI Probe](https://ooni.org/install/mobile): a free software app designed
to measure internet censorship and network performance.

The application deadline is **Sunday, 31st October 2021**.

# Job description

If you join our team, you will lead the development of the [OONI Probe mobile app](https://ooni.org/install/mobile), supporting human rights
defenders worldwide to investigate and fight internet censorship.

You will work on improving the OONI Probe mobile app and create new
features to meet our global community’s needs. The [Android app](https://github.com/ooni/probe-android) is currently written in
Java, while the [iOS app](https://github.com/ooni/probe-ios) is
written in Objective-C, but you are also welcome to use Kotlin or Swift.

Ideally, you would work on both the
[Android](https://github.com/ooni/probe-android) and
[iOS](https://github.com/ooni/probe-ios) versions of OONI Probe. But
as [OONI Probe Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openobservatory.ooniprobe)
is run by most OONI Probe users around the world, we are primarily
interested in contracting a developer with strong Android app
development experience and expertise.

This is a **full-time 12-month contract position**, starting ASAP. The
contract may be extended depending on the contractor’s performance and
the availability of funds. The yearly contractor fee will range between
**50,000-60,000 EUR** depending on the contractor’s relevant experience
and expertise.

**This is a fully remote position.** Even before the COVID-19 pandemic,
the OONI team always worked remotely online. We communicate and
coordinate through [OONI Slack channels](https://slack.ooni.org/), we
have video/voice meetings regularly, and we track our work on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ooni).

Our team members are currently based in Europe and North America, but we
encourage applications from anywhere in the world.

* Extensive experience with Objective-C development. Willingness to learn how to apply best coding practices to iOS development.

* Familiarity with the network measurement field.

* Knowledge of the Go and Python programming languages.

A degree is great but *not* required if you have the right experience.

# About

## OONI

The [Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)](https://ooni.org/) is a free software project -- born out of
the [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/) in 2011 -- that aims to
empower decentralized efforts in increasing transparency of internet
censorship around the world.

We build free software ([OONI Probe](https://ooni.org/install/)) that
enables anyone to independently detect internet censorship on their
network. To increase transparency of internet censorship, we publish
censorship measurements as [open data](https://ooni.org/data/) in near
real-time. This data supports [research](https://ooni.org/reports/)
and [advocacy efforts](https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/)
investigating and fighting internet censorship worldwide.

More information about OONI is available in our [Mission Statement](https://ooni.org/about/) and
[FAQ](https://ooni.org/support/faq).

## OONI Probe

Launched in [2017](https://ooni.org/post/ooni-mobile-app/), the [OONI Probe mobile app](https://ooni.org/install/mobile) is run by tens of
thousands of users in around 200 countries and territories every month.

OONI Probe provides human rights defenders a user-friendly way to
**detect and collect evidence of internet censorship**, and to
contribute it as [open data](https://ooni.org/data/).

Thanks to OONI Probe users worldwide, millions of network measurements
collected from 240 countries and territories have contributed towards
the [world’s largest open dataset on internet censorship](https://explorer.ooni.org/).
