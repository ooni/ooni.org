Are you attending the [Internet Measurement Conference (IMC)
2023](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2023/)?

Join us at the **[IMC Hackathon on Network Interference using Open
Data](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2023/hackaton/)** on Monday, **23rd
October 2023**, in Montreal, Canada. The hackathon is organized by the
[Internet Society (ISOC)](https://www.internetsociety.org/), the [Open
Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)](https://ooni.org/),
[M-Lab](https://www.measurementlab.net/) and [Censored
Planet.](https://censoredplanet.org/) 

IMC is a yearly academic conference focusing on Internet measurement and
analysis. The conference is sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM.

This IMC Hackathon will be about exploring, analyzing, and visualizing open
network measurement data with a focus on identifying Internet censorship and
Internet shutdown events. 

Participants and supporters of the hackathon include Internet measurement
professionals, students, data scientists and in general anyone passionate about
internet freedom. We encourage applications from people with diverse backgrounds (such as economists and social
scientists) who are interested in participating in the hackathon.
