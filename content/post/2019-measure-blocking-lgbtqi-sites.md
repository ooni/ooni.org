LGBTQI websites are blocked in several countries around the world, such
as
[Malaysia](https://sinarproject.org/digital-rights/updates/online-lgbt-censorship-malaysia)
and
[Indonesia](https://ooni.org/post/indonesia-internet-censorship/#lgbt).
This includes popular dating apps and sites, like
[grindr](https://www.grindr.com/), which is blocked in
[Lebanon](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/05/lebanon-ban-on-gay-dating-app-grindr-a-blow-for-sexual-rights-and-freedom/)
and
[Iran](https://ooni.org/post/iran-internet-censorship/#human-rights-issues).

How can we track the blocking of LGBTQI sites around the world?

We have teamed up with [OutRight Action International](https://outrightinternational.org/) -- a leading international LGBTQI human rights organization -- to investigate the blocking of LGBTQI sites worldwide.

We invite you to contribute to this research!

In this post, we explain how you can test the blocking of LGBTQI
websites in your country and contribute network measurement data which
will be [openly published](https://explorer.ooni.org/) to increase
transparency (and potentially serve as evidence).

# Measure the blocking of LGBTQI websites

You can participate in our research through the following steps:

* 1.) **Install the OONI Probe mobile app** (and turn-off your VPN):

    * [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openobservatory.ooniprobe)

    * [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1199566366)

* 2.) Tap on one of the **LGBTQI buttons** on this page: https://ooni.org/get-involved/run/

![OONI Run buttons](/post/lgbtqi-site-testing/lgbtqi-buttons.png)

**Note:** The “LGBTQI (26 URLs)” button includes 26 LGBTQI websites,
while the “LGBTQI (600 URLs)” button includes 600 LGBTQI websites. If
you’re connected to Wi-Fi, we encourage you to opt for more
comprehensive testing (600 URLs), whereas if you’re using mobile data,
you may find the testing of fewer websites (26 URLs) preferable.

* 3.) **Open the LGBTQI button with your OONI Probe mobile app** (not with a web browser).

* 4.) Tap **Run**

You can view the results through the **Test Results** section of your
OONI Probe mobile app.

Please note that false positives can occur.

## About OONI Probe

The [OONI Probe app](https://ooni.org/install/) includes tests
designed to measure various forms of internet censorship, including the
blocking of websites.

Every time you run an OONI Probe test, you collect network measurement
data which can potentially serve as *evidence of internet censorship*.

You will be able to see the results immediately inside the OONI Probe
app, and they will automatically be published on **[OONI Explorer](https://explorer.ooni.org/)** as well.

All results from OONI Probe users are automatically published on
OONI Explorer to help increase transparency of internet censorship
around the world. You can then download the measurements, perform your
own analysis, and use them as part of research, advocacy, policy, and
journalistic reporting.

### Heads-up

The OONI Probe app is not a privacy tool, but an investigatory tool,
as it's designed to expose various forms of internet censorship.

Keep in mind that:

* Anyone monitoring your internet activity (such as your government,
ISP, or employer) will know that you are running OONI Probe (just
the way they know what other software you run). Running OONI Probe
over a VPN is *not* recommended, as it may lead to
inaccurate results.

* Testing LGBTQI sites might attract the attention of those monitoring
your internet activity. This may be risky if LGBTQI rights are not
recognized in the country that you’re running OONI Probe from.

* By default, your OONI Probe test results will automatically get
[published](https://ooni.org/data/) to increase transparency.
You can opt-out from submitting your test results for publication
by disabling the Sharing options in the Settings of the OONI
Probe app.

please review our [Data Policy](https://ooni.org/about/data-policy/).

Thank you for helping us track the blocking of LGBTQI websites around the world!
