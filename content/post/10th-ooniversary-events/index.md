# About 10th Ooniversary

Ten years ago, the [Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)](https://ooni.org/) was created with a vision: Build tools that
enable anyone around the world to independently investigate internet
censorship and publish open data that increases transparency of internet
censorship worldwide.

Today, 10 years later, our [OONI Probe app](https://ooni.org/install/)
enables you to measure various forms of internet censorship, and we
publish OONI Probe measurements from around the world as [open data](https://ooni.org/data/) in real-time. This has enabled us to
publish [75 reports](https://ooni.org/reports/) in collaboration with
our global network of [partners](https://ooni.org/partners),
documenting internet censorship worldwide.

None of this would have been possible without our global community, who
contribute censorship measurements every day, increasing transparency of
internet censorship around the world.

In tribute to our community, we have set **5th December 2012 as OONI’s
birthday**, because that is the day when we published the first OONI
measurement.

To celebrate 10 years of OONI censorship measurement, join us for the
following 2 live-streamed events, where we’ll share highlights from the
past 10 years, as well as stories from our community.

# 10th Ooniversary: OONI Highlights
