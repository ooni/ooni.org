To better support the internet freedom community in monitoring and responding to censorship events, we’ve introduced several major enhancements over the past few years, including:
* New [OONI Explorer Censorship Findings](https://explorer.ooni.org/findings) platform
* New [OONI Explorer thematic censorship pages](https://ooni.org/post/2025-ooni-explorer-thematic-censorship-pages/)
* New [research reports](https://ooni.org/reports/) based on OONI data
* Methodological improvements (e.g., new [throttling methodology](https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/blob/master/docs/design/dd-007-throttling.md))
* Data analysis improvements through [OONI Pipeline v5](https://github.com/ooni/data)

We’re now seeking community feedback on these resources and methodological updates so we can evaluate their impact and continue improving them.

**Please take a few minutes to complete our survey:** https://forms.gle/6s7MWdtUViB1NRMK8 

We kindly ask that you submit your responses by **Sunday, 21 December 2025**.

Thank you for your time – your feedback is very valuable to us. Your input will help us enhance censorship monitoring tools and resources for the global internet freedom community.
