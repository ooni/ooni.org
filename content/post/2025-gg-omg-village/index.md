Are you attending the upcoming [Global Gathering](https://wiki.digitalrights.community/index.php?title=Global_Gathering_2025) event in Estoril, Portugal? Are you interested in investigating internet shutdowns and censorship, and curious to learn more about the tools and open datasets that support this work?

{{<img src="images/omg-banner.png" title="OMG Village announcement" alt="OMG Village announcement">}}

Join us at the Global Gathering **Open Measurement Gathering (OMG) Village**: a community space organized and hosted by 4 internet measurement projects: [Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)](https://ooni.org/), [Measurement Lab (M-Lab)](https://www.measurementlab.net/), [Internet Outage Detection & Analysis (IODA)](https://ioda.inetintel.cc.gatech.edu/), and [Censored Planet](https://censoredplanet.org/). We also have the pleasure of being joined by our friends [Netalitica](https://netalitica.com/) and [Project Ainita](https://ainita.net/), who will each host a booth on Day 3.

The OMG Village will take place at the Global Gathering event venue at **Booth 17** throughout the 3-day event, running from **1pm to 5:30pm daily from 8 to 10 September 2025**. We will use this space to host booths and circle discussions on topics related to censorship measurement. On Day 3, the OMG Village will host **community-led circle sessions** proposed by participants throughout the event. 

Whether you'd like to join one of our circle sessions, propose (and facilitate) a session, play a game of jeopardy, pick up some swag at our booth, or just say hi — be sure to drop by!

Below we share the detailed OMG Village agenda.

| 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM | Censored Planet         | Censored Planet is a research lab that investigates how internet access is being shaped and restricted around the world. As censorship tactics become more complex and harder to detect, we develop new ways to study these systems and understand who they affect. We focus on internet measurement, network security, and privacy to produce research and tools that support journalists, civil society, and the broader internet freedom community.                                                                                                                                   |
| 3:30 PM - 5:30 PM | Measurement Lab (M-Lab) | Founded in 2009, Measurement Lab (M-Lab) is an open platform for studying Internet performance and neutrality over time. M-Lab recently completed the first phase of the Internet Quality Barometer project, and published the IQB Framework in June 2025. The IQB project seeks to redefine internet quality beyond the single metric of speed by using available data. As M-Lab continues the IQB project to build a tool to score Internet quality, we are also interested in exploring ways to score Internet freedom with existing data. Come by our booth and share your thoughts! |

| 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM | Netalitica     | Netalitica Booth will introduce you to the "Test Lists Project". We hire local researchers to update the URL test lists (aka Citizen Lab lists) of multiple countries, which are then used by network probes (e.g. OONI Probe) to uncover Internet censorship. Come to our booth to learn how to update the test list of your country, see the results of our project and check out the vacant research positions!                                                                                                                                                      |
| 3:30 PM - 5:30 PM | Project Ainita | Project Ainita's Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) portal aims to be a one stop shop for latest intel, live Internet measurements and contextual analysis for circumvention tool makers, researchers, journalists, funders, decision makers and stakeholders needing current and deep understanding of a country's Internet status. We will be providing a live demo of the CTI portal as well as Internet maps of a few countries. We intend on being fully available for Q&A and hope to foster rich brainstorming discussions of scaling CTI in other needed contexts. |
