OONI will celebrate its 10th anniversary on 5th December 2022!

This is a time for celebration, but also a time for reflection: What
worked well? What should we improve? What should we do differently going
forward?

The OONI community has been at the heart of our work over the past
decade, and so we invite our community to help shape OONI’s strategic
priorities for the future.

Please take a few minutes to **complete our survey**:
[https://ooni.typeform.com/to/SiVfLeqm](https://ooni.typeform.com/to/SiVfLeqm)

We’d appreciate it if you could please submit your survey responses by
**Sunday, 20th November 2022**.

If you’d also like to participate in a recorded interview to share your
OONI community experience, please fill out the survey (while sharing
your email address through the last survey question) by Sunday, 6th
November 2022.

Thanks for your time, your feedback is very valuable to us. Thanks for
helping to shape OONI’s goals for the future!
