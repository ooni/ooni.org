[Digital Society of Africa (DSA)](https://digitalsociety.africa/) works to strengthen the resilience and ability of frontline activists, human rights defenders and other at-risk groups in six countries: Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Eswatini and South Africa. DSA leads the network of technologists and digital consultants, as well as [OONI Probe](https://ooni.org/install/) users in these countries and supports OONI with measuring and investigating internet censorship in southern Africa. 

Each year DSA hosts [ConnectCon](https://digitalsociety.africa/connectcon/), an event which brings together organizations and individuals from 6 southern African countries to discuss regional challenges, share experiences and knowledge, and build capacity for further collaboration.
