We are happy to celebrate OONI's 10th anniversary together with our
amazing community, who have been at the heart of our work over the past
decade.

Today, we are excited to share a **new video with OONI community
members**, where they discuss how OONI has been useful to their work,
while sharing what they would like to see OONI do in the future.

### Arthit Suriyawongkul, [Thai Netizen Network](https://thainetizen.org/)

Arthit works with the [Thai Netizen Network](https://thainetizen.org/), a leading non-profit
organization in Thailand that advocates for digital rights and civil
liberties. Founded in December 2008, it grew out of a group of netizens
who had concerns about limited internet freedom during post-coup
governments. Its activities are based on five themes: access to
information, freedom of opinion and expression, privacy, participatory
internet governance, and rights over information resources.

Thai Netizen Network supported OONI activities by updating the
country-specific test list for Thailand, coordinating censorship
measurement, and conducting [research
projects](https://ooni.org/post/thailand-internet-censorship/)
focused on local internet censorship.

### Arzu Geybulla, [Azerbaijan Internet Watch](https://www.az-netwatch.org/)

Arzu is a journalist from Azerbaijan focused on developments in
Azerbaijan, Caucasus, and Turkey. In 2019, she launched [Azerbaijan Internet Watch (AIW)](https://www.az-netwatch.org/), an
online platform tracking and mapping internet censorship and
surveillance in real-time in Azerbaijan.

We have worked together closely since the launch of the project and were
able to [publish several reports](https://ooni.org/partners/azerbaijan-internet-watch/)
on the state of internet censorship in Azerbaijan over the past years.
More recently, we collaborated on
[research](https://ooni.org/post/2022-azerbaijan-and-armenia-blocks-tiktok/)
investigating the blocking of TikTok (based on OONI data) in both
Armenia and Azerbaijan amid border clashes.

### Davide Brunello, Independent researcher

fighting internet shutdowns around the world. The #KeepItOn campaign was
created to monitor and advocate against internet shutdowns, and support
grassroots organizations with digital security training, circumvention
tips and advocacy funding.

Since 2016, OONI has [worked closely](https://ooni.org/partners/access-now/) with the
#KeepItOn campaign on coordinating censorship measurement efforts
(particularly leading up to and during [political
events](https://www.accessnow.org/internet-shutdowns-and-elections-handbook/),
which often [trigger new censorship events](https://ooni.org/reports/)) and on providing

The [Tor network](https://www.torproject.org/), which is
free and open source, provides its users with online anonymity, privacy,
and censorship circumvention. Tor software is designed to bounce
communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers
around the world, thereby hiding its users' IP addresses and enabling
them to circumvent online tracking and internet censorship.

OONI was born out of the Tor Project, back in 2011. Since then, we have
actively collaborated on [measuring Tor

around the world.

local communities with OONI censorship measurement research, and
[coordinated censorship measurement
campaigns](https://sinarproject.org/digital-rights/measuring-and-detecting-network-interference/ge15)

Based on OONI data, Sinar Project created the [Southeast Asia Censorship Dashboard](https://censorship.sinarproject.org/#/summary/2020)
