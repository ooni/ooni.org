Currently, the [50th session of the UN Human Rights Council](https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/hrc/regular-sessions/session50/regular-session) is taking place.

In response to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights’s [call for submissions](https://www.ohchr.org/en/calls-for-input/calls-input/call-comments-report-internet-shutdowns-and-human-rights-fiftieth)
in support of the [OHCHR report on internet shutdowns and human rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/hrc/regular-sessions/session50/list-reports)
to the 50th session of the Human Rights Council in June 2022, the OONI team provided a submission with relevant
information on the **occurrence of mandated disruptions of access to
social media and messaging platforms over the past 5 years** based on
empirical OONI network measurement data.
