Since 2006, Psiphon has provided open access to the internet for millions of citizens around the world.

Psiphon is a free and open source tool that utilizes VPN, SSH, and HTTP proxy technology for censorship circumvention. The [Psiphon VPN](https://psiphon.ca/en/download.html) essentially serves as a tunnel that enables you to circumvent censorship because you access resources on the internet through the non-censored tunnel that Psiphon provides.

OONI collaborated with Psiphon on developing an [OONI Probe test that measures whether the Psiphon app works](https://ooni.org/nettest/psiphon/) in a tested network. This test is available through the OONI Probe [mobile](https://ooni.org/install/mobile) and [desktop](https://ooni.org/install/desktop) apps.

We also collaborated on the [Psiphon Data Engine](https://psix.ca/), which integrates OONI measurements.
