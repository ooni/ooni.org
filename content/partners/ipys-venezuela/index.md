IPYS Venezuela works for a Venezuela where there is full enjoyment of freedom of expression and the right to information, and demands that the necessary guarantees to exercise free and plural journalism, allowing the scrutiny of power, be met.

For the advancement of this vision, and as an organization formed by professionals and defenders of communication, IPYS Venezuela promotes the development of journalists and communicators, as well as the establishment of conditions that guarantee an independent and vigilant investigative journalism.

IPYS Venezuela monitors and denounces violations of the exercise of the rights to free expression and access to information, safeguarding and protecting the rights of journalists and communication professionals to carry out their work.

IPYS Venezuela defends the legal framework that guarantees the exercise of freedom of expression and the right to information according to international standards, and as cornerstones of the democratic coexistence of citizens.
