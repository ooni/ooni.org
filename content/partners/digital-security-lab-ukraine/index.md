Digital Security Lab Ukraine managed efforts to establish a nationwide Internet censorship measurement system in Ukraine. In doing so, they engaged volunteers across different regions of Ukraine with the use of [OONI Probe](https://ooni.org/install/) for censorship measurement, and they performed analysis of [OONI data](https://ooni.org/data/) to uncover censorship events. They published several [reports](https://medium.com/@cyberlabukraine) documenting their findings, showing how internet censorship varies across regions and networks within Ukraine.
