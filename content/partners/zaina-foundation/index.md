Founded in 2017, [Zaina Foundation](https://zainafoundationtz.org/) is a non-governmental, non-profit organization registered under NGO’s Act of 2002 with the aim of promoting digital rights in Tanzania. 

Zaina Foundation’s vision is to empower women in technology through digital security and privacy capacity building, workshops and training. This is done by providing capacity building of digital security training to women and human rights defenders in Tanzania, localization and translation of open source tools in Swahili language in order to allow Swahili users to access secure tools for their communication. Moreover, Zaina Foundation monitors internet shutdowns in Tanzania. Through its UX Project, the organization tests open source tools, collects feedback from end users during training and shares such feedback with developers, in the quest to help improve the usability of digital security and censorship measurement tools.
