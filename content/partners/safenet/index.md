Every year, SAFEnet publishes the [Digital Rights Situation Report of Indonesia](https://safenet.or.id/2023/03/the-digital-rights-situation-in-indonesia-had-worsened/) in Bahasa Indonesia and English, in addition of quarterly reports. It includes contextual information and access of internet analysis.

In 2019, SAFEnet, in collaboration with Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) Indonesia and Press Legal Aid (LBH Pers), sued the Indonesian government in relation to the internet shutdown in Papua. SAFEnet and the coalition won the lawsuit.
