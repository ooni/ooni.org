Established in 2005, EngageMedia is a regional not-for-profit organisation with a distributed team in eight countries across APAC dedicated to [advocating digital rights](https://engagemedia.org/digitalrights/) and [championing open technology](https://engagemedia.org/opentech/) in the region. We combine capacity building, knowledge sharing, tech enablement, community development, and digital storytelling to support civil society organisers, grassroots activists, independent journalists, academics, lawyers, and other HRDs who are working towards the respect, promotion, and protection of human rights, democracy, and the environment in the region.
