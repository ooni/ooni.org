The Citizen Lab is an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy, University of Toronto, focusing on research, development, and high-level strategic policy and legal engagement at the intersection of information and communication technologies, human rights, and global security.

They use a “mixed methods” approach to research combining practices from political science, law, computer science, and area studies. Their research includes: investigating digital espionage against civil society, documenting Internet filtering and other technologies and practices that impact freedom of expression online, analyzing privacy, security, and information controls of popular applications, and examining transparency and accountability mechanisms relevant to the relationship between corporations and state agencies regarding personal data and other surveillance activities.

Since 2014, the Citizen Lab have hosted the [test lists](https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists) that contain URLs measured for censorship by projects like OONI. Over the years, we have collaborated on managing and updating these test lists, engaging researchers from around the world, and coordinating efforts to encourage community contributions.
