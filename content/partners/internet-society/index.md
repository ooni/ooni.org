The [Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/) is a global nonprofit empowering people to keep the Internet a force for good: open, globally connected, secure, and trustworthy. They believe that the Internet is for everyone. Their work centers on increasing the Internetâ€™s reach, reliability and resilience, as well as ensuring that the Internet remains open, globally connected, secure, and trustworthy. To assess whether these efforts are working, they're building [Internet Society Pulse](https://pulse.internetsociety.org/shutdowns) - a curated set of insights to help everyone gain deeper, data-driven insight into the health, availability and evolution of the global Internet. 

OONI is a [data partner](https://pulse.internetsociety.org/partners) for the Internet Society Pulse project.
