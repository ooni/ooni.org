Localization Lab believes that language shouldn't be a barrier when it comes to security and access to the Internet. Since 2012, they have helped expand the reach of Internet freedom tools by unlocking access to communities all over the world. 

To this end, Localization Lab work to: 

* Expand the reach of Internet freedom technology and supporting materials.

* Facilitate relationships between developers and end-users to increase the adoption of new technologies and ensure that community needs are being met.

* Collaborate with local partners to strengthen networks and increase impact.

They are a **global community of 7000+ contributors who support the translation and localization of Internet freedom tools** -- technologies that address access, security, digital literacy, and anonymity online to ensure that people around the world have safe avenues for accessing information on the Internet.

Since 2012, they have **made open source technology available to underrepresented communities in 220 languages**, bringing equal access to information, better representation online, and growing the user base of our supported projects.

Over the years, the Localization Lab has supported OONI with the [translation and localization of OONI Probe apps](https://www.transifex.com/otf/ooniprobe/).
