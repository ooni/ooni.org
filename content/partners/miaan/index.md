To achieve their goals, Miaan Group focus on three main areas:

* **Internet freedom and digital rights**: Miaan Group works to counter threats posed by online censorship, surveillance, network disruption, and government harassment by empowering citizens, activists, and technologists.
* **Capacity building and mentoring**: Miaan Group provides local networks inside Iran and diaspora-based human rights defenders with legal and technical expertise, research, and advocacy support to strengthen civil society and human rights organizations.
* **Policy and legal advocacy**: Miaan Group's advocacy efforts center on working with advocates and researchers to deliver information and recommendations to international stakeholders to influence policy and behavior inside Iran.

Miaan Group is dedicated to building a legal and policy structure that upholds and protects
human rights in Iran and the wider Middle East and North Africa region. To accomplish this, their
team is made up of experts with extensive backgrounds in research, advocacy, and journalism.
They possess a deep expertise of human rights law and policy, internet freedom and security,
and the rights of marginalized communities, including ethnic and religious minorities, women,
children, individuals with disabilities, and LGBTQI+ people.
