The Miaan Group is a nonprofit organization founded in 2019 to promote human rights, good governance, and social justice in Iran and the broader Middle East and North Africa region.

To achieve our goals, we focus on three main areas:

* **Internet freedom and digital rights**: We work to counter threats posed by online censorship, surveillance, network disruption, and government harassment by empowering citizens, activists, and technologists.
* **Capacity building and mentoring**: We provide local networks inside Iran and diaspora-based human rights defenders with legal and technical expertise, research, and advocacy support to strengthen civil society and human rights organizations.
* **Policy and legal advocacy**: Our advocacy efforts center on working with advocates and researchers to deliver information and recommendations to international stakeholders to influence policy and behavior inside Iran.
