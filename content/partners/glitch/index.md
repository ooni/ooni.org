The [Global Information Technology Controls Hub (GLITCH)](https://glitch.oii.ox.ac.uk/) is based at the
[Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/). GLITCH brings together
academics, organisations and other stakeholders researching digital
rights, information controls, internet shutdowns, and censorship. 

They take a highly interdisciplinary perspective on the study of information
controls, bringing together quantitative and qualitative tools in the social
sciences, statistics, and computer science to identify the root causes of
censorship and shutdowns, and their wider effects on individuals and societies.

GLITCH aims to make sense of the increasing amount of data on information
controls and digital rights abuses. They develop the tools and methods to analyse
and understand the causes of information controls and their effects, to
generate strong evidence for policy and activism, and to protect the
fundamental rights to expression, connection, and communication.
